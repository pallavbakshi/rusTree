# Introduction to RusTree

Welcome to RusTree!

RusTree is a command-line tool and Rust library designed to display directory structures in a tree-like format, similar to the classic `tree` command, but with enhanced features for analysis and output customization.

## What can RusTree do?

*   **Visualize Directory Structures:** Clearly see the hierarchy of files and folders.
*   **Analyze Content:** Get insights like file sizes, modification dates, line counts, and word counts.
*   **Apply Custom Logic:** Use built-in functions (or extend with your own) to process file contents and report results.
*   **Sort Entries:** Organize the tree output by name, size, modification time, or other criteria.
*   **Flexible Output:** Choose between plain text tree format or Markdown.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Built with Rust, aiming for compatibility across different operating systems.

## Who is this for?

*   **Developers:** Who need to quickly understand the layout of a project or directory.
*   **System Administrators:** For inspecting directory contents and sizes.
*   **Anyone working with files:** Who wants a more powerful alternative to basic `ls` or `dir` commands.
*   **Rustaceans:** Who want to use or contribute to a Rust-based utility.

This documentation will guide you through installing RusTree, using its command-line interface, and leveraging its capabilities as a Rust library in your own projects.
