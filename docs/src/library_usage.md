# Library Usage (API)

Beyond the command-line tool, `rustree` can be used as a library in your own Rust projects. This allows you to programmatically generate and process directory tree information.

## Adding RusTree as a Dependency

To use `rustree` in your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rustree = "0.1.0" # Replace with the desired version
```

## Core Concepts

The library revolves around a few key components:

-   [`RustreeLibConfig`](./library_usage/concepts.md#rustreelibconfig): A struct to configure the behavior of the tree generation (depth, hidden files, analysis options, sorting, etc.).
-   [`NodeInfo`](./library_usage/concepts.md#nodeinfo): A struct representing a single entry (file or directory) in the tree, containing its metadata and analysis results.
-   [`get_tree_nodes()`](./library_usage/concepts.md#get_tree_nodes): The main function to walk a directory, analyze entries, and return a `Vec<NodeInfo>`.
-   [`format_nodes()`](./library_usage/concepts.md#format_nodes): A function to format a `Vec<NodeInfo>` into a string representation (e.g., text tree, Markdown).
-   Enums for options like [`SortKey`](./library_usage/concepts.md#sortkey), [`LibOutputFormat`](./library_usage/concepts.md#liboutputformat), etc.

## Sub-sections:

- [Examples](./library_usage/examples.md): Code examples demonstrating how to use the library.

The API documentation generated by `cargo doc` (and available on `docs.rs` if published) provides the most detailed reference for all public items.
